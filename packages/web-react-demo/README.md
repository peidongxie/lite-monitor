## Background

LiteMonitor started with a database online examination real-time monitoring system. During the development of the system, I found that I needed a event tracking library that could meet the following characteristics:

- Lightweight
- Low invasiveness
- Well defined
- Good compatibility

As a result, I built a JavaScript library and published it to npm. In February 2021, I started developing version 1.0 of the project.
