## Background

LiteMonitor started with a database online examination real-time monitoring system. During the development of the system, I found that I needed an event tracking library that could meet the following characteristics:

- Lightweight
- Low invasiveness
- Well defined
- Good compatibility

As a result, I built a JavaScript library and published it to npm. In February 2021, I started developing version 1.0 of the project.

## Installation

This demo uses Node.js and pnpm. Please make sure they are installed locally.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/peidongxie/lite-monitor
$ cd lite-monitor/packages/node-koa-demo
$ pnpm install
```

## Usage

This demo can be started in production mode.

```sh
$ pnpm build
$ pnpm start
```
